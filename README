README:

Note that the directories in this readme begin at the root directory of the
source code, therefore if Battlesloth has been downloaded and decompressed to
/home/bhodgins/dev/battlesloth, /lib refers to /home/bhodgins/battlesloth/lib.

Do not use /bin/Battlecraft until a full bootstrap is capable. Instead, while
the source code is being populated you should bootstrap tests. For example, to
bootstrap the test summon, run the following command in /lib:

perl -MBattlesloth::Character::Summon::Test -e '$summon = Battlesloth::Character::Summon::Test->new()';

using perl -e , you can add whatever tests you like. any summon in the directory
/lib/Battlesloth/Character/Summon can be substituted for the test
summon. You don't have to use perl -e, obviously.

BlinkBox is important and not really well documented, so I decided to paste a
script i used to look inside the box, etcetera, just so you get the idea:

#!/usr/bin/env perl

use warnings;
use strict;

use lib qw(lib ../lib);
use Battlesloth::BlinkBox;
use Battlesloth::Character::Summon::Test;
use Battlesloth::Character::NPC::Test;
use Data::Dumper;


my $void = Battlesloth::BlinkBox->new();

$void->matter(
    [
     Battlesloth::Character::NPC::Test->new(),
     Battlesloth::Character::Summon::Test->new(),
    ]
    );

print Dumper $void->matter;

exit;

When BlinkBox is functional or complete, bless objects will be contained and
encapsulated within the BlinkBoxes 'void' space. Events will be able to pass
between objects, however the key in the design is that the objects will not
talk outside of the blinkbox in the direction of its caller. This does not
prevent you from using DBI modules, etc in the classes within the BlinkBox.

Bootstrap testing is not to be confused with Perl's Test modules. However, if
you wish to do so with them, make a directory /tests or simular (and if you are
a repository contributor DO NOT add it until production testing is ripe!).


CHANGELOG:

------------22 Jun 2011------------
-Noticed that /lib/Battlecraft/Status.pm still existed, removed.
-An example configuration file has been added to the new directory /etc
-Fixed BlinkBox's package name to correspond to its neighbors.
-Added the /lib/Battlesloth/Role/Class directory and add a Peasant class.

------------21 Jun 2011------------
-Repository created, basic skeletal design complete to an extent.
