README:

Note that the directories in this readme begin at the root directory of the
source code, therefore if Battlesloth has been downloaded and decompressed to
/home/bhodgins/dev/battlesloth, /lib refers to /home/bhodgins/battlesloth/lib.

Developers:
This README needs work, but remember to update the CHANGELOG every day you can,
remember git will only track your commits, not your daily summaries. If you're
the type to make a lot of changes before committing code over a few day basis or
more, the changelog is a good reminder of what's left to be done before code is
committed. If you don't want to deal with it, that's fine.


CHANGELOG:

--Brian-----04 Aug 2011------------
-A listening (yet non-functional) server exists in /bin/server.pl
-A script in /tools named generate_protocol.pl can be used to generate google
protobuf objects for the server which should make implementing a protocol much
easier.
-Modules in /lib/Battlesloth/Mechanics can be added, and should be responsible
for the math and ATB timing, etc. when the library becomes more mature.
-Got rid of the blinkbox idea. This is the servers problem, not the library's.
-we don't want /bin/battlesloth. At least right now, the name is misleading.

--Brian-----22 Jun 2011------------
-Noticed that /lib/Battlecraft/Status.pm still existed, removed.
-An example configuration file has been added to the new directory /etc
-Fixed BlinkBox's package name to correspond to its neighbors.
-Added the /lib/Battlesloth/Role/Class directory and add a Peasant class.

--Brian-----21 Jun 2011------------
-Repository created, basic skeletal design complete to an extent.
